# ü§ù Staking Dapp

MOUSE COIN Staking pools consolidate multiple POS validators into one pool in order to increase the rewards earned through staking. Multiple users can lock their tokens to a single validator node, which allows the node's smart contract to earn a larger share of the staking rewards due to the combined size of their staked capital.
