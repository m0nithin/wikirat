# ðŸ”¥ Automatic Burn

Inflation doesnâ€™t only apply to Fiat currencies; we can see it very clearly in the crypto world and in many projects, where the increase in the token supply -by printing or mining- eventually led to a decrease in value.

To hedge our currency from inflation, with each purchase, 1% of the quantity purchased will be burned, and with each sale, 1% of the quantity sold will be burned.&#x20;

### Example:

When buying 1,000  WKR tokens, 10 tokens will be burned, and in return, when selling 1,000 tokens, 10 tokens will be burned.

This method ensures that the number of tokens in the WKR ecosystem is constantly decreasing with each transaction, and that will contribute to an increase in the currencyâ€™s scarcity and value.
