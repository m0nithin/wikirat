# ü§ù Staking DAPP

#### WIKI RAT STAKING DAPP  <a href="#googly-swap-is-almost-ready" id="googly-swap-is-almost-ready"></a>

WIKI RAT Staking pools consolidate multiple POS validators into one pool in order to increase the rewards earned through staking. Multiple users can lock their tokens to a single validator node, which allows the node's smart contract to earn a larger share of the staking rewards due to the combined size of their staked capital.



Staking Will Be At Higher Floor
